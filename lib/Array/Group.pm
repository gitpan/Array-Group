=head1 NAME

Array::Group - Convert an array into array of arrayrefs of uniform size N.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Array::Group qw( :all );

  @sample = ( 1 .. 10 );
  $rowsize = 3;

  ngroup $rowsize => \@sample ;
  # yields
         (
            [   1,   2,   3   ],
            [   4,   5,   6   ],
            [   7,   8,   9   ],
            [   10   ]
          );

  dissect $rowsize => \@sample ;
  # yields
         (
            [   1,   5,   9   ],
            [   2,   6,  10   ],
            [   3,   7   ],
            [   4,   8   ]
          );



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<ngroup> method reformats a list into a list of
arrayrefs. It is often used for formatting data into HTML tables, amongst
other things.

C<dissect()> returns a list of lists where the first
element of each sublist will be one of the first elements of the
source list, and the last element will be one of the last.
This behaviour is much more useful when the input list is sorted.

The key difference between the two methods is that C<dissect()> takes
elements from the start of the list provided and pushes them onto each
of the subarrays sequentially, rather than simply dividing the list
into discrete chunks.

Both methods can be called as either functions or class methods (to
ensure compatibility with previous releases), and the array to be
reformed can be passed as a reference.

I would like to thank Alexandr Ciornii for his help in upgrading this
distribution's format. He took me from using a F<test.pl> file to using
the F<t/> directory and removed some old crufty things that were not needed.
He also upgraded the Makefile.PL.
